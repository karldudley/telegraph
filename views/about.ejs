    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>For this project we wanted to produce an anonymous message board where the posts persisted even if the server restarted.</h3><br>
    <h3>The technology we chose to solve this was MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based, non-relational database. The server app was built using node.js and a range of dependencies such as Express (for routing), Mongoose (to connect to MongoDB) and EJS (for server side rendering).</h3><br>
    <h3>It was deployed on <a href="https://telegraph-futureproof.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>.</h3>
