## Installation and usage

Users should be able to input their title, name and story. Upon entering data, users should be able to submit their data and view the data on a separate page.

### To run the app you have a few options:
1. Go to the deployed [site](https://telegraph-futureproof.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku (*Easiest*)
2. Run it in Docker - `docker compose up`
3. Run it locally - `npm install && npm run start`

## Changelog

## Bugs
